This is a demo project to start implementing OpenGL applications
using freeglut. 

This is a very simple version of snake game with few features. 
To use, simply open the file in xCode and build + run.
Noticeable Bugs:
  - Snake Can reverse direction by 180 degrees
  - Window resizing issue, scale of game appears smaller than is.
  
  
  Enjoy!
